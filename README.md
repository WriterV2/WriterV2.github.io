# Portfolio page - writerv2.github.io

My portfolio page should ideally give a visitor a little impression of me and my work/interests.

## Structure

This project derives content from JSON and uses Tera templating to generate HTML pages. This approach might seem like an over-kill for now, but my goal is to simplify the process of adding and updating the content in the long-term.

## ToDo

- More work pages (tools, games)
- Blog
- About Me
